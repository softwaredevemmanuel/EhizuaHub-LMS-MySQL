Dear Fullstack Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide you with a detailed list of features and functionalities that I would like to see incorporated into the HR app you are currently developing for our organization. Please consider the following elements as essential components of the app, in compliance with Nigerian labor laws:

Employee Details:

Comprehensive employee profiles, including personal information, contact details, and next of kin.
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) information for medical benefits management.
Time and Attendance:

Clock-in and clock-out functionality for tracking daily attendance.
Automatic calculation of hours worked.
Leave Management:

Monitoring and tracking of annual leave entitlements, as per Nigerian labor laws.
A system that enforces all employees taking leave simultaneously in December, resuming the second week of January.
Sick leave tracking, with an automatic cap on the number of sick days allowed, adhering to Nigerian labor laws.
A restriction on taking sick leave only when two days before the time, ensuring timely reporting.
Provisions to prevent sick leave usage after exhausting the allocated days (e.g., 10 days) within a given period.
Performance Management:

KPI (Key Performance Indicator) evaluations and tracking for performance assessment.
Salary Calculation:

Automatic salary calculation based on hours worked and relevant pay rates, in accordance with Nigerian labor laws.
Document Management:

A centralized repository for storing and managing HR-related documents, such as contracts, certifications, and policies.
Notifications and Reminders:

Alerts and reminders for employees and HR personnel regarding leave requests, performance reviews, and important HR deadlines.
Compliance with Nigerian Labor Laws:

Ensure that all features and functionalities are aligned with Nigerian labor laws and regulations.
I encourage the Fullstack Team to refer to HR apps like Bamboo and Seamless to gather insights and ideas on how to effectively implement these features. These apps can serve as valuable references for best practices and user-friendly design.

Please keep me updated on the progress of the HR app development, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any clarifications or additional information. I appreciate your dedication to this project and your commitment to helping us streamline our HR processes.

Thank you for your efforts in making this initiative a success.

Best regards, Ohaegbu Elizabeth, Human Resources Manager
